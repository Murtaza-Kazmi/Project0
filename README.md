Web Programming with Python and JavaScript</br>
This is kind of a portfolio website giving first a short introduction of myself followed by some projects that I have made yet.
-There are a total of 7 html pages, with index.html as the home page.
-Each of the 6 remaining pages contain a project, which can be opened by clicking on the project name on the home page i.e. index.html.
-Each of the 6 pages of projects has a back button in the top right corner.
-There are 4 .css files and 2 .scss files. The 2 .css files namely mainsass.css and sentsass.css are the converted versions of the original .scss files of the same name. The independent css files (meaning the files that were not converted from .scss format) are named main.css and sentiment.css.
-main.css and mainsass.css are the css files for index.html (the homepage), whereas sentiment.css and sentsass.css are the css files for all the  remaining 6 pages.
-All the requirements have been met as instructed in the assignment file.
